        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p>My name is Mary Dang and I am a front end developer based in the San Francisco Bay Area. I graduated with Bachelor's Degree in Finance in June of 2016.
          During my last year of college, I started getting into programming by watching videos online and building websites. It wasn't long before that I decided
          to start pursuing what was at first a learning experience as a career.</p>

        <h2>Innovative, Rewarding, and Fun</h2>
        <p>As a finance student, I worked with Excel in every class. I was able to build spreadsheets with formulas and it turned out I was good at this.
           I decided to start learning programming because SQL is a language finance professionals use but at my college, they didn't offer a SQL course.
           I joined Treehouse and quickly learned SQL, but it didn't stop there. I learned ruby and built ruby on rails applications, python, and then
          started getting into front end development. Through developing, I can explore my innovative side when figuring out how to go about a project and problem solving.
          With every project I complete, I feel rewarded and most importantly, I have fun.</p>
